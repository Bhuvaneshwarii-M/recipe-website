I've grown up in the kitchen along side my mum and grandmothers and conversations in my family are always about the next meal. I've picked up their love for food along the way, and with this webpage, I share my food story with you. Simply Recipes is here to help you cook delicious meals with less stress and more joy. We offer recipes and cooking advice for home cooks. Helping create “<b>KITCHEN WINS</b>” is what I am all about. Everyone is welcome at the Simply Recipes table: people of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, ages, backgrounds, and abilities. We strive to be a resource for every home cook, and I consciously work to make this inclusion felt in every part of the site. We're not perfect, but we hope to get more right than we get wrong. As we all know, cooking is not just about preparing meals; it's also a way to express ourselves, to show our creativity, and to connect with our emotions. Cooking can be a therapeutic activity that can help us deal with stress, anxiety, and other emotions that we may be experiencing. When we cook, we can focus on the task at hand and forget about our worries, even if it's just for a little while. The next time you step into the kitchen, take a moment to appreciate the emotional aspect of cooking and enjoy the process of creating something delicious and meaningful.</b></p></span></div><br><br>
