        <div> <span> <p style="padding: 20px; border: 3px solid black;">A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make a dish. If life could only be as simple as following a recipe, we'd all be much happier. However, unlike food based recipes, life doesn't provide you with standardized ingredients as each lives their unique life. It means we must cook with what we have and see what we can come up with it. However, just like cooking ...life has a lot of similarities. For instance, while some people like to follow the recipe to the core, others like to experiment with the ingredients creating their unique take on something that might have been passed down from generation to generation.</p></span></div>
